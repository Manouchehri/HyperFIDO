This repository contains some information on the Hypersecu HyperFIDO U2F USB token device. This product and others  seem to be using Feitian (飛天ジャパン株式会社)'s reference design (ePassFIDO-K5). I will continue to update this list as I find more derivatives.

I have not cracked open the case yet, so I don't know exactly what chips are being used internally.

If you're looking for sample projects, this is not the correct place.
